/*
 *   Enviroment Variable Server Error Throwing
 *
 *
 *   This code imports two objects from separate files that define the schema and environment variables for a Next.js app. 
 *   It then validates the server-side environment variables against the schema and throws an error if any are invalid. If 
 *   there are no errors, it checks to ensure that no server-side variables are being exposed to the client-side by checking 
 *   for any keys that start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_". Finally, it exports a merged object that contains all environment variables, 
 *   both server-side and client-side, that have been validated and processed.
 */
// @ts-check
/**
 * This file is included in `/next.config.mjs` which ensures the app isn't built with invalid env vars.
 * It has to be a `.mjs`-file to be imported there.
